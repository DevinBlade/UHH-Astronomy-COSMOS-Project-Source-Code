# UHH-Astronomy-COSMOS-Project-Source-Code
This is the source code for the University of Hawaii at Hilo Astronomy COSMOS Project. It was written in C++ and designed to be ran as a console application which searches through massive data files of Astronomy Data allowing the user to dynamically add specifications and restrictions to the row of data being analyzed before written to a new output file if it passes all inspections.
